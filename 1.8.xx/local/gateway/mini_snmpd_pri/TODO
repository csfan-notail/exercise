To do for version 1.1:

   *) some length calculation and encoding code exists in both mib.c and
      protocol.c with only slight differences; try to merge that

   *) the encode functions in mib.c do not check the size; this can be a
      problem when forgetting to initialize octet string MIB variables with
      their maximum length (only for strings, not for integers)

   *) check the relevant RFCs for the SNMP V1 and V2 MIBs and which parts of
      the system MIB are must be included

   *) add native support for FreeBSD system specific function (so that the
      user does not need to mount the linux compatible /proc filesystem)
