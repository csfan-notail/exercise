Mini SNMP Daemon Version 1.1

This program is a minimal implementation of an SNMP daemon. It does not support
the flexibility and features of the standard solution, net-snmp, but does not
have the memory requirements either (in fact, it uses about of 1/10th of RAM as
net-snmp on my development system).

The supported features are:

* SNMP version 1 and 2c
* Community string authentication when using 2c or explicitely configured
* Read-only access (writing is not supported)
* Includes basic system info like CPU load, memory, disk and network interfaces
* Ability to send traps on free disk space, CPU load, network interface status
* Does not need a configuation file
* Supports UDP and TCP (thus supports SSH tunneling of SNMP connections)
* Supports linux kernel versions 2.4 and 2.6
* Supports FreeBSD (needs procfs mounted using "mount_linprocfs procfs /proc")

The current version is a beta version; it is tested on IA32 and ARM platforms
using net-snmp as client.
